The Reals Blog is a way to document what I have learned in my Real Analysis class from last semester in a way that benefits me (in learning via the Feynman technique) and benefits anyone else looking to get a handle on Real Analysis.

## About Me

Hi! I'm Ben Laird. I'm an aspiring polymath who's studying Mathematics and minoring in Computer Science and Physics at Liberty University. I'd like to become a quantum computer scientist, with special emphasis in quantum algorithm design. Essentially, I want to use quantum stuff to make computers go faster and do more that we couldn't before.

In the meantime, I'm a full-stack web developer, a theoretical mathematician, an improving physicist, and a bettering chemist. I like to learn about whatever I can and teach others what I've learned, that way they can learn more and teach me in return, and we can all collaborate for the betterment of all involved. I'm also a bit of a nerd culture fan.

If you like what you see, make sure to thank [Sat Naing](https://github.com/satnaing/) for the [blog template](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper), and check out some of my other stuff on [GitHub](https://github.com/ben-laird), including my [changes](https://github.com/ben-laird/reals-blog) to the template. If you _really_ like what you see, you can support me and my open-source work financially through [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/benlaird) (or tea, because coffee is cringe).
